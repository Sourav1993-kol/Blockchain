3.What are the few features which blockchain will give you?
Ans: Can not be corrupted. There are some exciting blockchain features but among them "Immutablilty" is undountedly one of the key features of Blockchain technology. Decentralized technology, Enhanced security, Distributed ledgers, Consensus, faster settlement.

4. What all things does a block contains?
Ans: Each block contains, among other things, the current time and record of some or all recent transactions and a reference to the block that came immediately before it. It also contains an answer to a difficult -to-solve mathematical puzzle the answer to which is unique to each block.

5. How is the verifiability of blockchain been attained?
Ans: Transaction are encrypted and stored on multiple devices, or nodes around the globe. This decentralization, transparency, widely-verifiable, and append-only nature makes it almost impossible to tamper with data. Therefore, access can be restricted and information can be encrypted to protect confidentiality.
